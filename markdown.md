#### Choosing a Text Editor

Choosing a text editor is completely based on preference. There are a lot of factors that go into which one you choose, such as customization settings, operating system, and extension options, but it all boils down to what you want or need from a text editor. Text editors often come with your operating system, however these are very basic and there are no customization or extension options. Each text editor has its pros and cons.

#### The Command Line

The terminal is really powerful on a computer. As they say, however, with great power comes great responsibility. IT's a text-based interface, and you can input and execute commands for your whole computer from there.

#### Navigation

Commands: pwd, AKA print working directory; cd, change directory; touch <FILENAME>, create new file; ls, list contents of directory; mkdir <directory name>, create directory; mv, move; cp, copy
  
Navigation mainly relies on commands. There are paths that guide the code on what to do: relative and absolute. These mean that the path is based on where you are in the code, or are the same no matter where you are, respectfully.

### About Files

Literally everything within Linux is a file. Everything from actual files to directories is a file. Commands associated with files include file, which gives you information about what type of a file a file/directory is, and ls -a, which lists everything in a directory, including hidden files. Linux is extensionless, so a file can have any extension, but it is also case-sensitive, so be careful.
