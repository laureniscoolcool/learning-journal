### Growth Mindset

Growth mindset is a way of thinking that allows for intellectual growth and the belief that intellectual growth can occur. The fact that it's intellectual growth is mostly specific to a situation, **in reality any type of growth can be viewed with a growth mindset**. To me, this means taking any negative thoughts I may have about my work, my abilities, my progress, or even my classmates' competence over my own, and turning them into positive thoughts about how I can grow and how it's good that we can all grow together. Growth mindset is about remembering you *can* grow and you *can* change.

Remember, in the words of Walt Disney:
> All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.

#### Ways to Keep a Growth Mindset
- Remeber to keep positive thoughts about my work and my ability.
- Realize that anything I don't know or think I can't get, I will eventually. I just have to give it time.
- Everyone has the ability to learn and grow as a person, no matter what. Human beings are remarkably good at changing, and I can decide to change for the better.
